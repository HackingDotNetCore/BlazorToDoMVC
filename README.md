# BlazorToDoMVC

This is a demo for a talk given at KCDC in 2018 on Blazor.  

Specifically, this demo shows the traditional ToDoMVC example

[This commit](https://github.com/scottsauber/BlazorToDoMVC/commit/f9e5c300e5ff1ca1139e0d6289515a10a686d3fe) shows how you could add local storage to make the ToDoItems persist.
